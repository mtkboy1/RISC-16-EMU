<h1>Why should I use this</h1>
<p>It doesn't need to be used as something that should work for the consumer üßí. But it can be used as a manual if you want to understand how emulators work üî¶.</p>
<h1>How to use it</h1>
<p>After downloading the project, go to main.c and there you can start writing commands using cpu.rom[number] = command. After that, do not forget to change the number of commands in run(&link, number)</p>
